  "description": "## What are we building Welcome to this tutorial on building a simple staking dApp on the Core blockchain. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a basic staking dApp that allows users to stake, unstake, and claim rewards. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional dApp that interacts with smart contracts on the Core Testnet.  In this staking dapp, 2 custom ERC20 tokens are used namely, `Staking Token - STK` and `Reward Token - RTK`. While, `STK` is used for staking, the `RTK` token is used for rewarding the users for staking their `STK` tokens.",
